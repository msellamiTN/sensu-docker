Run Docker Compose:
Save the docker-compose.yml file.
Run the following command in the directory where you saved the file:
 
sudo docker-compose up -d
Check Sensu Backend Version:

After the containers are up and running, you can check the version with the curl command you provided:
 
curl -s http://localhost:8080/version
This docker-compose setup will start Sensu services in a more manageable and declarative way. Docker Compose is great for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
